# simple-chat

This is a simple chat application. I join here the usage of Flask and a pre-trained transformer-based llm.

# Quickstart

## Setup Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the application

- Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

- The server will be running at `http://localhost:5000/` as default.
